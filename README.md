# Raspberry Pi Weather Station

The weather station kit is a HAT for the Raspberry Pi which allows it to collect weather data using a variety of sensors. It is designed for use in schools to enable students to create their own weather station and has a range of resources to support its use.

As well as logging data locally, schools that received a free weather station can log their data to a central Oracle database so they can share and collaborate with schools round the world.

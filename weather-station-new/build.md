# Building your Weather Station Part I
1. Your Raspberry Pi Weather Station should arrive in a sleeved box.
   ![](images/build_01.jpg)
1. Open the box and remove it's contents.

1. Remove the contents of *Board Mounting Kit*

1. Use the *4 x 8mm Fixing Screws* and the *4 Hex Spacers* to affix the Raspberry Pi to it's acrylic base. Then place the *CN19895 Receptacle* over the Raspberry Pi's GPIO pins.

1. Take the coin cell battery and insert it into the *Weather Board*.

1. You can now place the *Weather board* over the Raspberry Pi, making sure that the mount on the *Weather board* aligns with the pins of the *CN19895 Receptacle*.

1. Use the *4 x 6mm Fixing Screws* to secure the *Weather board* to the Raspberry Pi.

1. Use a credit card, placed between the pins on the *Receptacle* to angle each row of pins outwards a little, to ensure a good contact is made.

   ![](images/build_15.jpg)
1. You can now plug in a keyboard, mouse, Ethernet cable, and HDMI cable to the Raspberry Pi.
   ![](images/build_16.jpg)
1. To power your Raspberry Pi, you could use a standard 5V power supply or the include *Power Over Ethernet* (POE) kit.
   ![](images/build_17.jpg)
1. Connect an Ethernet cable (not included) to the two POE adaptors. then plug in the power supply to the appropriate adaptor.
   ![](images/build_18.jpg)
1. One adaptor plugs into the Raspberry Pi as shown below. The other end can be connected to a network point and a wall socket.
